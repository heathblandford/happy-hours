This is a website dedicated to the happy hour specials in my home city of Cincinnati.

Currently the website is pulling from a single JSON object, which was converted from CSV to JSON, so the next big upgrade will be moving from the JSON to a SQL backend.

Also some upgrades will be an "Add your own" feature, and a "correct us if we're wrong" feature where someone (or a bar themselves) can let me know if I have a deal wrong, or if I have a bar with no deal for that day!

Pull Requests welcome!


To Do:

- [x] Modal on card click 
  - [x] "tell us we're wrong" feature would be. allows users to update happy hour deal
- [x] move from single JSON file to database
  - [x] Add your own on main page - should just be a + sign?
- [x] Finish design, and make look good... I'm not designer but I'll give it the ol' college try!
  - [ ] consistent font styles across, and colors
    - [ ] Colors? Branding?
-[ ] submit on contact us isn't working
