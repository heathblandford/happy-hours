This is a website dedicated to the happy hour specials in my home city of Cincinnati.

Currently the website is pulling from a single JSON object, which was converted from CSV to JSON, so the next big upgrade will be moving from the JSON to a noSQL backend with Node, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

Also some upgrades will be an "Add your own" feature, and a "correct us if we're wrong" feature where someone (or a bar themselves) can let us know if we have a deal wrong, or if we have a bar with no deal for that day!

Pull Requests welcome!
